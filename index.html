    <h1>Kushal Patel</h1>

    <p> I studied Mathematics at the University of Bath. My degree has given me a lot of knowledge 
        and background into a variety of programming languages and since I have a passion for 
        technology, I would love to pursue it further and enhance my coding skills. From all my 
        modules throughout my three years at university, I have had a lot of experience in 
        MATLAB, Java, R and Python. Additionally, in my spare time I took courses in Codeacademy for 
        Python and Java. One of my recent projects at university was to code a Sudoku solver which 
        can take any given unsolved Sudoku and produce the solved Sudoku as an output.
